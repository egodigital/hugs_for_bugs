# Readme

This project deals with motivating the tenants to use the car-sharing service more often by improving their overall experience and providing them small incentives to use the service. The major points are summarised and explained below:    


## Car-Sharing model
Once logged into the app, you can book a car for the desired date and time. If a car is available for that duration, you should be able to book it directly, else you will be able to see the booking schedules for the desired date and see if any of the times suit you. You can also mark if you are open to sharing your ride with other tenants, add your destination and how many extra people can travel with you. This way you can gain extra points in the gamification model. 


## Gamification model

A Tenant rating system has been introduced which will be used to prioritise their bookings (in case two users book the same car for the same starting time). 

Tenants will get bonus points for :
* Sharing the ride with other tenants.
* Returning the car on time. 
* Using the car in off-peak hours(11:00-15:00h or 23:00-05:00h).

On the other hand, Tenants will lose points for:
* Returning the car late. 
* Causing damage to the car.

These points can further be used to avail certain services for free, such as using the washing machine/dryer for no charge, booking the common hall for reduced price or in the ultimate case, getting some refund on rent payment.
